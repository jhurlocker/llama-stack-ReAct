🤔 **Simple Query:**
   "What is the vacation balance for employee EMP001?"

🧠 **Complex Reasoning:**
   "If user EMP001 has enough remaining vacation days, book two days off for 2nd and 3rd of July 2025"

🔄 **Multi-step Analysis:**
   "Check if EMP001 has any vacation days left, and if so, suggest when they might want to use them"
